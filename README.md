## QR-Based Attendance System

**Overview**
The QR-Based Attendance System is a web application designed to simplify the process of tracking and managing attendance. Using QR codes, users can mark their attendance efficiently by scanning the code via their mobile devices. This system provides real-time attendance management and offers a secure and streamlined alternative to traditional attendance systems.

**Features**
QR Code Generation: Generates unique QR codes for each user/event.

Attendance Tracking: Users scan their QR code to mark their attendance.

Admin Dashboard: Admins can view, add, and manage users and their attendance records.

Real-time Attendance Updates: Admins get instant updates whenever a user marks their attendance.

Authentication: Secure login system for admins and users.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
QR Code Generation: qrcode package
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
Real-time Communication: Socket.IO
Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive and clean design.

**Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js (v14+)
MongoDB
npm or yarn
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/kuldeepverma7309/QR-based-attendence.git

2. Install Dependencies
cd backend
npm install

cd frontend
npm install
3. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory with the following environment variables:

makefile
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
4. Running the Application

**Backend**
cd backend
npm run dev

**Frontend**
cd frontend
npm start

5. Database Setup
Make sure MongoDB is running on your system. Once you start the backend, collections for users and attendance records will be automatically created.

Usage
1. Admin Login
Admins can log in with their credentials to access the dashboard, view attendance records, and generate QR codes for users.

2. QR Code Scanning
Users scan their generated QR codes from their mobile devices, which will mark their attendance in the system.

3. Attendance Overview
Admins can view real-time attendance updates for different users and download attendance reports if needed.

## Development Considerations
Security: Implemented JWT for user authentication. All sensitive routes are protected.
Scalability: Designed the system to easily support additional users and events by using MongoDB as a flexible database.
